## ELEC 327 Final Project

# Motivation
Solar energy is a clean, renewable, and inexhaustible energy source increasingly used in transportation, lighting, and many more applications. Solar energy has great potential because it is derived from the sun's radiation and is accessible as long as the sun exists. However, a major problem is that we are currently able to harness only 0.001 percent of the total amount of solar energy available. Solar energy is harnessed through solar panels. For our project, we built a light-tracking solar panel whose surface points in the direction with greatest light, allowing more solar energy to be collected and produced.
